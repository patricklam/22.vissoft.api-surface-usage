\label{sec:discussion}
We believe that using this visualization, library developers can make
decisions about pruning or modifying unused APIs and refactor their
libraries, while client developers can make decisions about library
upgrades and breaking changes.

% can we talk about the use of tests a bit more? how do we miss stuff?

We discuss ways in which our visualization may not yield the
information that developers are looking for. First, client tests may
not adequately represent actual client behaviours; our use of both static
and dynamic information helps mitigate this issue. However, because we use
class hierarchy analysis for our static analysis, our visualization will present
all possible static calls, even if the calls could be ruled out by a more
precise call graph.

This preliminary work has presented two usage scenarios which we
believe promise to be useful for both client and library
developers. Consistent with the Call for Papers for the NIER track for
this work, we have not yet carried out a formal evaluation of our
VizAPI tool. We intend to carry out further evaluation of our tool
following the techniques described by Merino et al~\cite{merino}.

%Cite a systematic literature review of software visualization evaluation (Merino et al)? Merino is PC chair and talk about how we don't have an evaluation yet but it's not required for NIER.
