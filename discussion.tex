\label{sec:discussion}

We start our discussion with threats to validity. The first one is that 
client tests may not adequately represent actual client behaviours.
Secondly, we use class hierarchy analysis for our static analysis. 
This might be unsound --- in our case, it means that we detect a higher number of 
possible calls.

We believe that using this visualization, library developers can make decisions about 
pruning or modifying unused APIs and refactor their libraries, while client developers can make 
decisions about library upgrades and breaking changes.


CHA  - does it need to be cited?

Cite a systematic literature review of software visualization evaluation (Merino et al)? Merino is PC chair and talk about how we don't have an evaluation yet but it's not required for NIER.
