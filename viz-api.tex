We next describe the design of VizAPI, including details on how we
collect information and format it for the d3js visualization
library. We also present two case studies showing potential uses of
VizAPI.

\subsection{Design}
\label{subsec:collecting-data}
Our goal is to visualize interactions between software components---between
clients and libraries, and between libraries and other libraries. We now explain
how we collect static and dynamic information about software behaviour.
Figure~\ref{fig:workflow} summarizes how VizAPI works.

To identify interactions across the client/library boundaries,
we first inspect JAR files of each software component to obtain a list of
classes for every component. We then associate classes and their members to
components based on these lists.

\paragraph{Static information} We perform a static analysis to record
API uses. Using Javassist~\cite{chiba00:_load_struc_reflec_java}, we identify type
references, which includes references at call sites, fields, annotations for 
classes, methods and fields, method parameters and casts. 
We also identify subtypes, determining possible 
interactions across client/library boundaries and library/library boundaries.
Javassist uses
a call graph produced by class hierarchy analysis to resolve method calls.

\paragraph{Dynamic information} We collect dynamic data by running client
test suites under instrumentation. 
The instrumentation records API
uses which cross client/library boundaries, as well as library/library boundaries
for libraries that are transitively used. We also use
Javassist to perform this
instrumentation and then use the build system of each project (Maven or Gradle) to run its
tests.

\end{center}
\end{figure*}

At every invoke instruction in every
loaded method which transfers control between the client and the
library, we add code to record that invoke by incrementing a counter.
We handle both static and virtual (including special, virtual,
interface, and dynamic) calls. Crossing the client/library boundary
includes callbacks from the library to the client as well as conventional
calls from the client to the library. 

We also record field accesses (direct and reflective), dynamic proxies
and reflective calls, Java annotations, implementations,
instantiations, and casts.

\subsection{Visualization System}
\label{subsec:vis-system}

Once we have generated data, we use a modified version
of the d3graph\footnote{\url{https://pypi.org/project/d3graph/}} library in Python to generate a d3js\footnote{\url{https://d3js.org/}}
visualization. 
The graph in Figure~\ref{fig:usagescenario1}
is an example of a graph produced by VizAPI.

VizAPI graphs are force-directed graphs based on the frequency of
interactions between different software components.  Each node is a
set of one or more packages that belong to the same JAR.  There are
three categories of nodes: clients are represented by nodes with white
interiors; libraries by nodes with filled interiors and black borders;
and dependencies (called by libraries but not clients) by nodes with
filled interiors and normal borders.  We coalesce nodes if they
originate from the same JAR file and have the same incoming and
outgoing edges.

Each edge is directed
from the source package(s) to the target package(s) and represents an interaction 
(invocations, fields, annotations, subtyping) between packages. 
The thickness of each edge reflects the frequency of interactions between the source and the target.
Double-clicking on a node emphasizes its direct interactions with other packages while fading out the rest of the graph.

We run a Python implementation of the Louvain clustering algorithm~\cite{blondel2008fast}, and make the clusters 
visible by colouring nodes based on cluster.
This means that the same colour could indicate nodes (of the same category) from the same or different JARs.
Hovering on a node shows the list of packages and 
the JAR that they belong to, 
formatted as “jar : $\langle$space separated list of packages$\rangle$”. 

\subsection{Case Study}
\label{subsec:evaluation}

We conducted a pilot study of VizAPI.
We have generated data from libraries from a subset of the
Duets benchmarks~\cite{durieux21} combined with a selection of
popular Maven repositories 
in different categories such as logging and json parsing.
Our study included 10 libraries and
selected clients of these libraries (potentially overlapping), for a total of 85 projects.
We have made our data publicly available\footnote{\url{https://zenodo.org/record/6951140}}.

We chose clients partly
from popular Github repositories and partly from Duets.
We have collected both static and dynamic data for these projects, 
and we are in a position
to generate graphs for combinations of clients and libraries
in these projects. 
We present two usage scenarios below; graphs for 
our usage scenarios are publicly available.\footnote{\url{https://sruthivenkat.github.io/VizAPI-graph/}}
We intend for these usage scenarios to show how VizAPI can be useful to client developers when they want to observe library API usage and for library developers when they want to observe how their library is used by clients.

\paragraph{Usage Scenario 1: jsoup}
Imagine that we are a jsoup developer and want to understand
how some clients interact with it, in anticipation of making some breaking changes. We choose clients JsoupXpath\footnote{\url{https://github.com/zhegexiaohuozi/JsoupXpath}\label{jsoupxpath}} and ez-vcard\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mangstadt/ez-vcard}\label{ez-vcard}}.
Figure~\ref{fig:usagescenario1} shows static and dynamic interactions of the 2 clients with the jsoup\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jhy/jsoup}\label{jsoup}} library. Recall that nodes represent packages and edges represent interactions (usually invocations) between packages. 

We can start our exploration with the cluster of pink nodes. Many of these nodes belong to either JsoupXpath or jsoup. Hovering over a node tells us the package names while double-clicking shows us its direct interactions. (To search for a package, we can click on ``show package names'' and use the browser's find functionality.) Here, client JsoupXpath calls directly into \texttt{org.jsoup.nodes} and \texttt{org.jsoup.select}. Notably, and as we might expect, we can see that \texttt{org.jsoup.helper} and \texttt{org.jsoup.internal} aren't called directly by JsoupXpath. This would mean that breaking changes in \texttt{org.jsoup.helper} or \texttt{org.jsoup.internal} wouldn't directly affect JsoupXpath\footnote{As a specific example, the retraction of an internal jsoup API would not break this client. Behavioural changes that are directly passed through to the external API, e.g. through delegation, can still break clients, but we can consider those to be changes in the external API.} 

Similarly, ez-vcard, which belongs to the purple cluster in Figure~\ref{fig:usagescenario1}, directly calls into \texttt{org.jsoup}. ez-vcard also calls into jackson-core\footnote{\url{https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core}\label{jackson-core}} and jackson-databind\footnote{\url{https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind}\label{jackson-databind}}, which are very tightly coupled amongst their own packages and with each other. As a jsoup developer, we wouuld be indifferent; others, however, can observe that breaking changes in jackson-core and jackson-databind could propagate.

\paragraph{Usage Scenario 2: dataprocessor}

Figure~\ref{fig:usagescenario2} presents a second usage scenario. Here, say we are the developers of client dataprocessor\footnote{\url{https://github.com/dadiyang/dataprocessor}\label{dataprocessor}} (hollow with orange border). This client uses the fastjson\footnote{\url{https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson}\label{fastjson}} library (green fill). Our visualization shows calls only from dataprocessor package \texttt{com.github.dataprocessor.slice}, which is the orange-bordered client node (identity of the package available by hovering) to the package \texttt{com.alibaba.fastjson}. No other parts of dataprocessor use fastjson. This means that when we, as dataprocessor developers, need to upgrade the fastjson version, we only need to inspect the source code in the \texttt{com.github.dataprocessor.slice} package. 

Note also the disconnected nodes in Figure~\ref{fig:usagescenario2}. These are all packages of fastjson that are unused by dataprocessor: any breaking changes in these packages definitely do not directly affect dataprocessor, and are less likely to affect it overall than packages that are directly used.
